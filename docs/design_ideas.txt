package name: logtree? maybe someone can suggest other catchy name :)

functionalies:
    custom messages / hint(I perfer called it this way): 
        allow user to prompt their messages if they know the exceptions/situations they are encountered with.

    stack messages:
        this logged the actual exception messages that occurred, usually is an array of string

    meta:
        contains all the info, includes level, service

implement functions:
    createLogger(config: key/value data) for sure
    
    createMeta(meta: key/value data) {
        should contains = {
            level: { 
                shows how fucked up you are in a short way. 
                default values = [
                    info:   normal,
                    success: normal / stack(optional), 
                    warn:   stack, 
                    error:  stack, 
                    fatal:  stack
                    trace/debug ?: stack
                ]
            }
        }
    }
